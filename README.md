# thermo_2022

**DISCLAIMER**: These CGIs were borrowed/developed/adapted for my _first time ever teaching Thermo_. They are very much under revision and development. Some major things to keep in mind: 

- There are some pesky typos and errors that were corrected during class that I forgot to update as we were going; sorry!
- The structure of the CGIs evolves particularly among the first three, towards a design that more integrates guided inquiry activities done in class and problem set-style problems worked outside of class
- The first two CGIs in particular were quite time-intensive for students, paring them down may be beneficial 
- This class (attempted to) integrate both a statistical mechanics and a classical mechanics treatment of thermo 
- This course was taught at an institution with a short (13-week) semester, during a term that had multiple unanticipated class cancellations due to external on-campus events; this class also covers kinetics, not (yet) captured in the course CGIs. 


That said, the CGIs included here cover: 
 
CGI_01: Getting Started in Python: Python and P(T,V) surfaces
CGI_02: The relationships between internal energy, heat, work, and heat capacity 
CGI_03: Enthalpy
CGI_04a: Configuration Weights (Dominant Configurations)
CGI_04b: Partition function and probability distributions 
CGI_05: Entropy 
CGI_06: Free Energy
CGI_07: Chemical Potential, Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams
